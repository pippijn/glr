title: Detect and remove unreachable parse tree nodes
desc: |-
  In some cases, a nonterminal is used only for syntax, but its contents are
  irrelevant. In these cases, the parse tree node is unreachable from the root
  node. Instead of uselessly creating and immediately dropping a parse tree
  node, we should return unit.
  
  EmitPtree: For this, we need to construct an AST representation on a higher
  level than the Caml AST we currently produce. A subsequent pass over this AST
  can remove unreachable types.
  
  PtreeMaker: The module creating parse tree actions may need to know about
  unreachable types, as well.

    Unreachable parse tree nodes are now no longer emitted and the semantic
    actions yield unit.
