title: Improve performance of LR item set construction
desc: |-
  On my machine, the LR item set construction takes around 0.5 seconds. This is
  too long. A complete menhir run on the same grammar, including table
  construction, takes 0.7 seconds (bison runs in 0.3 seconds). I believe that
  our algorithm performs redundant computations, but my understanding is
  currently too limited to recognise opportunities for optimisation.

    Profiling suggests that move_dot_no_closure takes most time and that
    comparing symbols (GrammarUtil.equal_symbol) is the most called function.
